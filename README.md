- Just a simple poject to help me understand and write a **YARA** rules.

- YARA rules checker against provided binary for detection based on the rules.

- Contains simple C files that can be compiled and checked against the main program. (remove the `mkfifo` on windows, or write your own)

- WIP :)



# TODO
